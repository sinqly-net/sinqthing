# Sinqthing

**This Project is Work in progress!**

Sinqthing is a customizable control interface designed to breathe new life into old smartphones or tablets. By turning a secondary device into a smart, dedicated media control panel, Sinqthing allows you to manage your music playback, view currently playing tracks, and much more — all from a sleek, touch-friendly UI.

## Features

#### 📱 Use Any Device

Install Sinqthing on an old smartphone, tablet or Raspberry Pi and transform it into a powerful media control hub.

#### 🎵 Music Control

Connect Sinqthing to your preferred music service and control playback seamlessly. Track information, cover art, and playback status are displayed in real time.

#### 🌐 Web-Based Frontend

The frontend is built with Angular, styled using Tailwind CSS and Flowbite components, providing a responsive and modern UI.

## Current Tech Stack

Frontend: Angular 20

Styling: Tailwind CSS + Flowbite

Packaging (Mobile): Tauri 2.0 (planned)

## Roadmap

#### 💻 Desktop Companion App

A native desktop application is planned to allow easier integration and richer features. The framework/stack for this part is still under evaluation.

#### 🎛️ Interactive Controls

Configure custom buttons and actions, similar to a programmable control deck. Launch apps, execute commands, or trigger shortcuts — all from your device.

#### 🔧 More Integrations

Support for additional media providers and custom automations.

#### 🧠 Home-Assistant

Support for Control and Monitoring of your Home-Assistant

#### 📡 Wireless Communication

Seamless communication between devices without needing direct USB or wired connections.
